# Evaluation of a simple parameterization of the Evaporative Stress Index using FLUXNET data and a planetary boundary layer model

Code for wrangling and performing analyses with [FLUXNET](https://fluxnet.org/) 2015 eddy covariance data to better understand the relationship between vegetation-atmosphere interactions (reflected in atmospheric humidity) and soil moisture. Written by Nicole Keeney and Dennis Baldocchi @ UC Berkeley. Description will be extended to compliment Baldocchi et al. (in progress)
