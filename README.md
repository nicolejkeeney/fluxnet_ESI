# Atmospheric Humidity Deficits Tell Us About How Soil Moisture Deficits Down-Regulate Ecosystem Evaporation
Python code repository for wrangling and performing analyses with [FLUXNET](https://fluxnet.org/) 2015 eddy covariance data to better understand the relationship between vegetation-atmosphere interactions and soil moisture. This code supplements Baldocchi et al. (2021); see citation below. Code written by Nicole Keeney and Dennis Baldocchi @ UC Berkeley.
