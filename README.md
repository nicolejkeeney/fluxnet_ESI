# Abstract 

The Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) is a drought index that describes temporal anomalies in evapotranspiration, providing an important measure of ecosystem water stress and soil moisture deficits. We evaluate a simple parameterization of ESI introduced by Fisher et al. (2008) as a soil moisture constraint that is reliant only on relative humidity, vapor pressure deficit, and a power law parameter, greatly reducing the number of input parameters required and allowing for calculation of soil moisture deficits using atmospheric variables that can be easily measured from space. Calculation of ESI is typically dependent on complex parameterizations of evapotranspiration and knowledge of the surface energy budget, with limited utility if all input variables are not known or if measurement error is large. Evaluations of our proposed ESI parameterization using both a planetary boundary layer model and eddy covariance tower data from FLUXNET 2015 indicate that the model is a good approximation of ESI, particularly when the power law parameter is calculated by ecotype. Our analysis suggests that biosphere- atmosphere interactions, which directly impact vapor pressure deficit and relative humidity, can provide a simple but effective measure of soil moisture deficits.
